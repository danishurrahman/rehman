<p style="background-color:red;color:black">In musical notation, accidentals are placed before the note symbols. 
Systematic alterations to the seven lettered pitches in the scale can be indicated by placing the symbols in the key signature, which then apply implicitly to all occurrences of corresponding notes.
 Explicitly noted accidentals can be used to override this effect for the remainder of a bar. A special accidental, the natural symbol<img src="t1.png" alt="t1" style="width:100px;border-radius:100px">, is used to indicate an unmodified pitch. 
Effects of key signature and local accidentals do not accumulate. If the key signature indicates , a local flat before a G makes it<img src="t2.png" alt="t2" style="width:100px;border-radius:100px">, though often this type of rare accidental is expressed as a natural, 
followed by a flat (♮♭) to make this clear. <br>Likewise (and more commonly), a double sharp double sharp sign on a key signature with a single sharp <img src="t3.png" alt="t3" style="width:100px;border-radius:100px">, indicates only a double sharp, not a triple sharp.
